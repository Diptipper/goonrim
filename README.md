# Skyrim gooner-edition installation guide
As per usual for any open source environments, installing a bunch of different mods made by different people is a pain in the butt because of the dependency hell.
I try to make my and your life easier by compiling a list of compatible mods and tools to make sure that everything goes as smoothly as possible.

From here, I will assume you are installing Skyrim Anniversary Edition `v1.6.1170.0` (you can check this from `SkyrimSE.exe`) Note that `v1.6.1179.0` is the GOG version which I cannot guarrantee if it will work.

For nexus mod, when I write `version xx`, look at the top-right corner for each file panel. There is a version number there. If you can't find the version I specified, try looking at the `Old files` section at the bottom of the page.

## Essentials
- Skyrim Anniversary Edition `v1.6.1170.0`
