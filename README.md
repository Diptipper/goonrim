# Skyrim gooner-edition installation guide
As per usual for any open source environments, installing a bunch of different mods made by different people is a pain in the butt because of the dependency hell.
I try to make my and your life easier by compiling a list of compatible mods and tools to make sure that everything goes as smoothly as possible.

From here, I will assume you are installing Skyrim Anniversary Edition `v1.6.1170.0` (you can check this from `SkyrimSE.exe`) Note that `v1.6.1179.0` is the GOG version which I cannot guarrantee if it will work.

For nexus mod, when I write `version xx`, look at the top-right corner for each file panel. There is a version number there. If you can't find the version I specified, try looking at the `Old files` section at the bottom of the page.

I'm using vortex, but you can use any mod loader as long as you know how to sort the mods and use external tools like Nemesis, etc. If you are using Vortex like I do, I recommend downloading everything manually and import them into Vortex later.
